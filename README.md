- **[SASS](./src/scss/pages/_gamescreen.scss)**

## Game guidelines:

- In order to play the game, players need to sign up and sign in.
- After signing in, players can choose to join an empty or waiting table. (A waiting table means one player already joined)
- When two players are ready, the game can get started.

## Rules:

- In total, there are 10 dices rolled. Each player can only see the results of 5 dices on their part. They have to guess the number (X) of dice (Y) on the table. For example, there are 4 times of dice 6 in total on the table.
- The game can continue with both players guessing the results. Or, one player can choose to challenge the bid of the other player, and the game will end. If the bid from player A, for example, is smaller or equal to the real results, A will win.
